# Human Motor Learning (HML) Model for High-dimensional Motor Systems
This repository contains MATLAB implementation of the HML model presented in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.13258).

Additional files are required to reproduce the results presented in the paper concerning various human motor learning behavior.

The folder *pierellaModelFits* contains MATLAB codes that compare the HML model with the state-of-the-art human motor learning dynamics model presented in [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1007118).
